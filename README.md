# ♟️ BattleChess

Battle Chess is a strategy game developed in C++ using the SFML library. The game features various classes and files to represent chess pieces and game mechanics.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of C++ by developing a chess program from scratch. What started as a simple chess game has evolved into an ambitious project featuring multiple classes of unique pieces, each with their own special abilities. The game is a work in progress, with additional features planned, including a point system, strategic army development, a tutorial, and online multiplayer capabilities. 

Artwork and design we're handled on my own, and I will likely circle back on it in the future.
